        "Our project, City Watch, investigates patterns of criminal activity in Chicago using the Crimes - 2001 to Present dataset provided by the City of Chicago’s open data portal. The dataset contains over 8.4 million records of reported crimes spanning from 2001 to the present, including details such as the type of crime, location, date and time, arrest status, and FBI crime code.\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary goal of our analysis is to uncover spatial and temporal crime trends, identify hotspots (areas and time periods with high concentrations of criminal activity), and predict potential future hotspots. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, we aim to create insights that could help city planners, law enforcement, and the general public understand crime dynamics more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key problems we are investigating include:\n",
        "\t1.\tCrime Hotspot Detection: Which neighborhoods and time periods experience the highest frequency of crimes?\n",
        "\t2.\tTemporal Patterns: How do crimes vary by season, time of day, and year?\n",
        "\t3.\tPredictive Modeling: Can we forecast where and when future crimes are most likely to occur based on historical data?"
